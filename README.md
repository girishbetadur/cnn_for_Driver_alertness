# Driver_Alertness
# This is a Deep Learning project for Driver Alertness Detection
# Here we used CNN model to train wake and sleep data of a driver
# The model file and data set can be found in this drive link :  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18fwa8AHzcACraW1Zxlk4gFIlkBda-Tj9
# If you want to recereate the CNN model use cnn_model_build.ipynb and change parameters if required according to applicataion
# There are several files in the repository
# pred_file.ipynb is the main program
# cnn_model_build.ipynb is the cnn_model building code
# pred_file.html is the html version
# Download model file "cnn_model.h5" from the google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18fwa8AHzcACraW1Zxlk4gFIlkBda-Tj9, this is imported in line 11 of the code
# there are 4 sample files, 2 sleep and 2 awake in this repository 
# can be used for testing if needed(in line 8 of the code), rest all the files can be found in the drive - DATA_SET folder
# report of the project is uploaded as well, read through if required - capstone_project_24may_rev copy.pdf
